# Peptide therapeutics: current status and future directions

[doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2014.10.003)

## data point
* More than 7000 naturally occurring peptide have been identified.
* approximately 140 peptide therapeutics are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. (2015)
* the peptide-based medicine Lupron from abbott laboraries for the treatment of prostate cancer and more, achieved global sales of more than US $2.3 billon in 2011.
* Lantus from Sanofi reached sales of US $7.9 billon in 2013.
* there are more than 60 US FDA-approved peptide medicines on the market
* more than 500 therapeutic peptides in preclinical development.
* the global peptide drug market has been predicted to increase from US $14.1 billon in 2011 to an estimated US $25.4 billon in 2018
* the novel innovative peptide drugs increase from US $ US8.6 billon in 2011 (60%) to $ US17.0 billon in 2018 (66%)
* GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), a group of agonists fro the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), reached total sales of over US $2.6 billon in 2013. 


## knowledge point
* natural peptide often hava crucial roles in human physiology, including actions as hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, ion chanel ligands, or anti-infectives.
* natural peptides are often not suitiable for use as convenient therapeutics because they have intrinsic weaknesses, including poor chemical and physical stability, and a short circulating plasma half-life.
* peptide represent an excellent starting point for the design of novel therapeutics and their specificity has been seen to translate into excellent safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles in humans.
* peptide therapeutics are typically associated with lower production complexity compaired with protein-based biopharmaceuticals.
* new peptide technologies (has been emerging that represent the opporunities and furture directions within the peptide field): 
    1. multifunctional and cell penetrating peptides
    2. peptide drug conjugates
    3. technologies focusing on alternative routes of administration

## conclusions
* peptides are in the sweet spot between small molecules and biopharmaceuticals.
